# Digitakt II - How to record via overbridge

- Digitakt
- Should receive midi via usb
- Should receive transport msgs and clock

To Ableton Live

- On the main channel strip click right on one of the scenes (field), then select Trigger recording on launch
- Route to the inputs of the various channels
- Select Auto on all channels
- Hit the record button on all channels
- Set a metronom one bar count in
- Go to settings record warp launch and set default launch quantisation to 4 bars
- To record, click on the play button of a scene
- Before (!) the end of two bars click that play button of the scene again
    - that way, it stops right at 4 beats for all the clips
- Note that also the inputs can be directly recorded which is good for melodic, non-repetetive, material
